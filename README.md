# MACH Tutorial Wing Repository

This repo contains files related to the "MACH Tutorial Wing", a proposed benchmark model for the high-fidelity aeroelastic optimization community.

For more details on the wing model and the corresponding benchmark optimization problems, see our paper "A Proposed Benchmark Model for Practical Aeroelastic Optimization of Aircraft Wings".

If you use this model and/or the benchmark problems in your research, please cite the paper, a bibtex entry is provided in `CITATION.bib`.

This repo includes:

- OML and wingbox CAD files
- Aerodynamic and structural meshes
- FFD control volumes
- Geometry and aircraft specifications
